            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Although the paÅ¿Å¿ages were too full of Å¿ouldiers for him to goe the neereÅ¿t way: for which cauÅ¿e, and for the better commodity of lodging, Å¿haping his courÅ¿e from <hi>Prage</hi> full North; on the thirteenth of September hee Å¿et out from <hi>Brandis:</hi> which Towne being no great State, is in the Å¿ame longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and latitude with <hi>Prage,</hi> that is, 29. and 46. and Å¿ome odde minutes, and vpon the great and faire riuer of <hi>Elbe</hi> or <hi>Albis,</hi> which the Bohemians call <hi>Labe;</hi> which we paÅ¿Å¿ing, came the Å¿ame day to <hi>WieÅ¿waÅ¿Å¿er,</hi> which Å¿ignifies in EngliÅ¿h White wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Bohemians call it <hi>Biela:</hi> an ancient City it is, and though it be Å¿ituated in the Kingdome of

            </p>
            <p>Hereabouts are alÅ¿o (almoÅ¿t) continuall great waldts or woods, which marching from the banks almoÅ¿t of the riuer <hi>Elbe,</hi> EaÅ¿t and WeÅ¿t, tend euen to the borders of the vpper <hi>LuÅ¿atia,</hi> which is one of the incorporated Prouinces belonging to the Kingdome of <hi>Bohemia:</hi> At this <hi>WiÅ¿waÅ¿Å¿er</hi> the Prince was met by the Inhabitants, and brought into the CaÅ¿tle, and there by the Burgraues appointment (himÅ¿elfe being through Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e vnable to come to waite vpon the Prince) hee was for that night entertained by the Citizens with very good ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eruance.</p>
            <p>The next morning being the 14. of September, the Citizens brought him on his way with an able Conuoy of 150. horÅ¿e and foot, till hee paÅ¿t out of <hi>Bohemia</hi> into <hi>Leutznatz</hi> or <hi>LuÅ¿atia;</hi> where at his firÅ¿t entrance the townÅ¿men of <hi>Gabel</hi> met him, the chiefe of which company in the name of the townÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men made a complementall Oration, intimating their faithfull loues, and his moÅ¿t hearty welcome vnto them. The Oration being ended, hee was conducted by them towards <hi>Gabel.</hi> Within halfe a miles riding he was met by a troope of horÅ¿e, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about 150. which were Å¿ent from the MarqueÅ¿Å¿e of <hi>IegerenÅ¿dorf.</hi> Here the Conuoy of <hi>WiÅ¿waÅ¿Å¿er</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned backe, and this troope brought him to the towne of <hi>Gabel,</hi> here the Prince dined. This <hi>Gabel</hi> is one of the firÅ¿t good townes on the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20047:3"/> of <hi>LuÅ¿atia</hi> towards <hi>Bohemia;</hi> it Å¿tands neere vnto the riuer of <hi>NieÅ¿Å¿e</hi> one of the chiefe Floods of <hi>LuÅ¿atia,</hi> which riÅ¿es not farre from hence.</p>
            <p>From hence departing after dinner, about a mile off from the Towne, he was met by a Å¿econd troupe of horÅ¿e, Å¿ent alÅ¿o from the Å¿aid MarqueÅ¿Å¿e of <hi>IegerenÅ¿dorf,</hi> by which troupes his HighneÅ¿Å¿e was conuoyed to the City of <hi>Zittaw</hi> or <hi>Sittaw,</hi> Å¿tanding vpon the riuer of <hi>NieÅ¿Å¿e.</hi> At the entrance whereof, he was receiued by two other troopes of horÅ¿e, and three companies of foot, beÅ¿ides the Citizens themÅ¿elues Å¿tanding all in their Armes on each Å¿ide, with muÅ¿icke of Trumpets on the Cathedrall Church, and Haultboyes on the tower of the StatehouÅ¿e, which Å¿ounded vntill the Prince was entred into his lodging. Before which, by commandement of the towne, was placed a Å¿trong Guard of both horÅ¿e and foot, beÅ¿ides two compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of foot placed within the gates in the Court, for defence of his perÅ¿on. And at each gate of the City for that night was Å¿et an extraordinary Å¿trong Court of Guard both of horÅ¿e and foot, the times being then dangerous, becauÅ¿e the Duke of <hi>Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> was then in Armes, and held his Leaguer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the City of <hi>Baultzen,</hi> within foure miles to the North-WeÅ¿t of that place, vpon the riuer of <hi>Spre;</hi> and we were now vpon the borders of <hi>MeiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿en,</hi> which is one of the Duke of <hi>Saxonies</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and confines vpon <hi>LuÅ¿atia,</hi> by a long tract of ground. And thus farre euen from <hi>Prage</hi> in <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia</hi> vnto <hi>Zittaw</hi> in <hi>LuÅ¿atia,</hi> our Court was full North.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:20047:4"/>
            <p>But the next day being the 15. of September, departing from thence, we tooke vp vpon the right hand more towards the EaÅ¿t, Å¿etting forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Gorlitz,</hi> which alÅ¿o Å¿tands vpon the riuer of <hi>NieÅ¿Å¿</hi> aforeÅ¿aid, which riuer riÅ¿ing in the Country of <hi>MieÅ¿Å¿en</hi> (I take it) eaÅ¿t-ward of <hi>Gabel,</hi> paÅ¿Å¿eth by <hi>Zittaw, Gorlitz,</hi> and Å¿o north-ward through both the <hi>LuÅ¿atiaes,</hi> till it fals into the <hi>Oder,</hi> which parts <hi>LuÅ¿atia</hi> from <hi>SileÅ¿ia.</hi> On the way towards this <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litz,</hi> (the Princes horÅ¿es being almoÅ¿t wearied) he was met by certaine Coaches and diuers troopes of horÅ¿e, Å¿ent from the MarqueÅ¿Å¿e of <hi>IegerenÅ¿dorf,</hi> who in that time of warre had his chiefe reÅ¿idence in that City. This guard tooke vp both Å¿ides of the way for a mile and a halfe together: and within halfe a mile off the City, the MarqueÅ¿Å¿e himÅ¿elfe in perÅ¿on met the Prince, accompanied with 4000 horÅ¿e and foote. And within a quarter of a mile off the City, he was receiued by the Citizens, ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging themÅ¿elues in armour on both Å¿ides the way, their order extending euen to the very entrance of the MarqueÅ¿Å¿e his Palace. For the Princes better contentment, the Å¿ouldiers were all commanded to march by in Battaglia and warlike order, with Drummes, Fifes, and EnÅ¿ignes diÅ¿played. After all which the Prince was by the MarqueÅ¿Å¿e and all his Councell moÅ¿t royally feaÅ¿ted. He was lodged in the Palace in a moÅ¿t faire chamber, richly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hed, and cut with antique works of great art and beauty. At this good entertainment we Å¿tayed two nights and two dayes.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Gorlitz</hi> is the chiefe towne of the vpper

At our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach within two miles of the town, we might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Souldiers both HorÅ¿e and Foot drawne forth in two diuiÅ¿ions, the HorÅ¿e in one, and the Foot in the other, and both ranged in battell-aray. The reaÅ¿on of this demeanour, was a iealouÅ¿ie of Å¿ome treachery which they conceiued to be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againÅ¿t their GariÅ¿on, for that the night before the Princes Quarter-maÅ¿ter being Å¿ent before, to giue them intelligence of his Highnes comming, they Å¿uppoÅ¿ed him to haue bin a Å¿py, and clapt him vp cloÅ¿e priÅ¿oner, lading him with irons.

Whereupon they being better Å¿atisfied, and all miÅ¿truÅ¿t being quite taken away, the chiefe Burgers of the Towne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced forwards, and comming to the Prince, they kiÅ¿t his Highnes hand: And after Å¿ome Å¿olemne Speech of entertainment, with their excuÅ¿e allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, for their late behauiour, imputing the Å¿ame to the danger of the time, and their vnexpected and Å¿odaine notice of his arriuall, the Prince mounted on horÅ¿e-backe, &amp; rode cleare through their troops towards the Towne: and hauing paÅ¿t them, the horÅ¿e and foot diÅ¿charged three vollies of Å¿hot for his welcome: &amp; comming to the gates of the town he was receiued by a guard of towne-dwellers, and by them conueyed to his place of reÅ¿t, where for that day he dined, where alÅ¿o the MarqueÅ¿Å¿e of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerenÅ¿dorfs</hi> Conuoy of horÅ¿e left vs, and returned to <hi>Gorlitz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This towne of <hi>Lauben</hi> is Å¿ituated vpon the banks of the Riuer <hi>Queis,</hi> which alÅ¿o runnes into the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and is neare vnto the borders of <hi>SileÅ¿ia,</hi> and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a necke of land which thruÅ¿ts out from <hi>Bohemia</hi> alÅ¿o, which being very narrow at <hi>Gabel,</hi> we touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon <hi>MieÅ¿Å¿en</hi> the Duke of <hi>Saxonies</hi> Country.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Lauben</hi> is in the frontiers (as it were) both of <hi>Bohemia</hi> on the South-Å¿ide, and <hi>SileÅ¿ia</hi> on the EaÅ¿t, it Å¿elfe being the vtmoÅ¿t towne of the vpper <hi>LuÅ¿atia,</hi> which makes the GariÅ¿on to Å¿tand more warily vpon their guard.</p>
            <p>After dinner he was conducted out of the Å¿ame Towne by a troope of horÅ¿e of the towne gariÅ¿on, which waited vpon his Highnes, till hee came to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20047:5"/> the Citie of <hi>Limberge</hi> in <hi>SileÅ¿ia,</hi> which town Å¿tands vpon the Riuer of <hi>Bober,</hi> and not farre from the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Queis</hi> aforeÅ¿aid. But before he came neare the Citie, the Prince was met by a troope of horÅ¿e from thence, in the middeÅ¿t of whom he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiged to his lodging in the towne, which was one of the chiefe Burgers houÅ¿es, where they placed a Å¿trong guard at the doore, for the Å¿afety of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on. This was vpon a Saturday at night.</p>
            <p>That day (his Highnes comming thither being knowne abroad in the country) all the young No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry thereabouts came in to Å¿ee the Prince, and to wait vpon his Highnes at table at Supper-time, Å¿o that all the Princes Å¿eruants were for that time diÅ¿miÅ¿Å¿ed from their attendance vpon him.</p>
            <p>The next day being Sunday, and <hi>Septemb.</hi> 19. the Prince mounted on horÅ¿e-backe, the Nobilitie go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before him on foot, and their children on each Å¿ide, with the troops of horÅ¿e and Foot attending. In which Å¿tately and Å¿olemne manner his Highnes rode to Church, and heard a Sermon. Whence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned, he dined with the Nobility.</p>
            <p>After dinner the Å¿ame day, he was by them and their troops conducted to the Citie of <hi>SomponÅ¿el,</hi> where he was moÅ¿t nobly entertayned of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens. So Å¿oon as the Prince was diÅ¿couered by the Watch vpon their Towers, they Å¿ounded their Trumpets, and beat vp their great kettle-Drums, continuing Å¿o vntill he came to the gates. Where as Å¿oone as he was entred, the TownÅ¿-men making a guard of themÅ¿elues, gaue the Prince a luÅ¿ty volley
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20047:6"/> of Å¿hot for his welcome. Then with the Å¿ound of Corners and Haultboyes he was entertained to his lodging. At the entrance whereof the TownÅ¿-men gaue him another volley of Å¿hot, and placing a Å¿trong court of guard for that night before his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, departed.</p>
            <p>The 20. of <hi>Sept.</hi> the Nobilitie tooke their leaue of the Prince, and the TownÅ¿-men waited vpon him with a conuoy to a place called <hi>Crozan,</hi> or <hi>CroÅ¿Å¿en,</hi> where his Highnes dined.</p>
            <p>After dinner the Å¿ame Conuoy brought him through till hee came to a citie called <hi>FrieÅ¿tadt,</hi> which is not farre from the borders of Poland, and lyes to the North the riuer <hi>Oder,</hi> running between this part of <hi>SileÅ¿ia</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> through the Duchy of <hi>CroÅ¿Å¿en,</hi> which is finally parted from hence by a ledge of woody mountaines, tending north-weÅ¿t and by north by a long tract to the EaÅ¿t-ward Here the troopes of <hi>SomponÅ¿el</hi> left him, and returned homewards, the Souldiers both horÅ¿e and foote of <hi>FrieÅ¿tadt</hi> receiuing him into their rankes in warlike order. All which by reaÅ¿on it was late and darke, was done by the Citizens by torch-light: by whom hee was gallantly conducted to his lodging, where he reÅ¿ted for that night.</p>
            <p>This being the laÅ¿t towne we lay at in <hi>SileÅ¿ia,</hi> the next day being the 21. of September, the Prince being conuoyed by Å¿ome horÅ¿e of the towne, wee entred into the <hi>Brandenburgher</hi> marck, that is, the marches or borders of the land of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> through which we paÅ¿Å¿ed on to the City of <hi>Franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> vpon <hi>Oder,</hi> Å¿o called, to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h it from
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20047:6"/> the other <hi>Franckford</hi> which is neere to the Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, where the great Mart is twice a yeare kept; which is alÅ¿o called <hi>Franckford</hi> vpon <hi>Maine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e that that Å¿tands vpon the riuer of <hi>Maine,</hi> as this doth vpon the riuer of <hi>Oder.</hi> This laÅ¿t towne being vnder the gouernment of the MarqueÅ¿Å¿e E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> the chiefe Citizens at the Princes arriuall (according to their wonted man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to noble Å¿trangers) preÅ¿ented their loues in huge flaggons of wine (which growes here) and banquetting Å¿tuffe, to the Prince; their flaggons being Å¿o much the greater, in regard of their loues to the DucheÅ¿Å¿e of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> their PrinceÅ¿Å¿e, who is Aunt to the Prince. This being moreouer the generall courteÅ¿ie of the great Cities of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> to preÅ¿ent their loues to all Princes their friends, and AmbaÅ¿Å¿adors of Princes, with an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Burgers bring each of them a great bottle of wine, which hangs by a ringle vpon his arme; and if hee hath any buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e or EmbaÅ¿Å¿ie to their State, they Å¿end him alÅ¿o Oates and FiÅ¿h.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Franckford</hi> is eÅ¿teemed the third towne of worth in the Country, and being vpon the very North weÅ¿t angle of <hi>SileÅ¿ia,</hi> and about Å¿ome 14. yeares before our being there (viz. <hi>Anno</hi> 1606.) was made an VniuerÅ¿ity by <hi>Ioachim</hi> MarqueÅ¿Å¿e of <hi>Brandenburg:</hi> the <hi>Oder</hi> runnes vpon the EaÅ¿t Å¿ide, the other parts are fenced in by the mountaines.</p>
            <p>From hence vpon the 22 of September wee Å¿et forwards towards <hi>RutterÅ¿dorp,</hi> but the way being waÅ¿te ground, and without habitation, wee were faine to haue our prouiÅ¿ion carried along with vs,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:20047:7"/> and dined that day at a Boers houÅ¿e. The Å¿ame night his HighneÅ¿Å¿e came to the village of <hi>RutterÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorp,</hi> where he lodged in the CaÅ¿tle, both which belong vnto the MarqueÅ¿Å¿e of <hi>Brandenburg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this place (the MarqueÅ¿Å¿e himÅ¿elfe being then in <hi>PruÅ¿sia</hi> or <hi>Pruce</hi> land) the Prince was faine for that night to content himÅ¿elfe with Å¿uch enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment as the place could afford. But the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneÅ¿Å¿e being certified of the Prince her Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes being there, Å¿ent poÅ¿t all night, with plate and other prouiÅ¿ion; which made Å¿o good Å¿peed, that by the morning there was Å¿tore of furniture, and by break-faÅ¿t time very good variety of proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion of all Å¿orts; which was a Å¿trange change, and a Å¿udden alteration, ouer night to be Å¿erued in veÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿els of Tin, and in the morning to haue a Cupbord of Plate. And thus by the DucheÅ¿Å¿e noble care, the Princes Å¿upper was well mended, by a full and Å¿ufficient break-faÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>This MarchioneÅ¿Å¿e of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> is named <hi>Elizabetha Charlotta,</hi> daughter to <hi>Fredericke</hi> the fourth Prince Elector Palatine; and Å¿iÅ¿ter to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the Princes father.</p>
            <p>After which the 23: of September hee Å¿et on towards <hi>Berlin,</hi> the Court of the MarqueÅ¿Å¿e, and ordinary place of his reÅ¿idence. The DucheÅ¿Å¿e hearing of his aproach, by a PoÅ¿t which the Prince diÅ¿patcht to her aforehand, to giue her HighneÅ¿Å¿e notice of his being Å¿o nigh; the DucheÅ¿Å¿e Å¿ent forth her brother Prince <hi>Lodowicke,</hi> Duke of <hi>Simmern,</hi> and vncle to the Prince, together with a young PoliÅ¿h Duke (whoÅ¿e father had beene baniÅ¿hed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20047:7"/> out of <hi>Poland</hi>) and Count <hi>Philip van Solmes,</hi> who all with a faire traine came to meet the Prince, of whom, after moÅ¿t ioyfull and mutuall Å¿alutations, he was brought into the Palace, where his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e with the reÅ¿t of his followers were moÅ¿t nobly welcomed, and royally feaÅ¿ted.</p>
            <p>This gallant young Prince, vncle to our Prince <hi>Fredericke,</hi> is Å¿tiled <hi>Lodowicke Philip,</hi> Count Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, &amp;c. was borne Nouem. 22. 1602. had the two Dukedomes of <hi>Simmern, Lautern,</hi> with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Sponheim</hi> aÅ¿Å¿igned him for his portion, by his fathers TeÅ¿tament; which was confirmed vnto him by the Emperour <hi>Rodulphus</hi> the Å¿econd: he going vp with his brother into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> had all his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try &amp; goods taken from him by <hi>Spinola</hi> in the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate: hee went from <hi>Prage</hi> to <hi>Berlin</hi> before Prince <hi>Fredericke,</hi> where they now meeting, went into the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> together.</p>
            <p>Here we abode ten dayes, hauing as great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of entertainment, as that time of mourning would permit. For the old MarqueÅ¿Å¿e Elector be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lately deceaÅ¿ed, and the houÅ¿hold and whole Court all in mourning, and the day of the Funerall drawing neere, was not a time of mirth or mask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In our Å¿tay here, this one thing was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding well worth the Å¿eeing and remembring, which was this; The time of the Funerall growing, the vault in the great Church was opened, where MarqueÅ¿Å¿es Electors of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> Å¿till vÅ¿e to be enterred. The Prince and all we of his traine were brought in to Å¿ee the place; going downe into which, there was an obiect of State Antiquity and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20047:8"/> much reuerence, namely, the bodies of 16 Princes embaulmed in Coffins of Tin, and laid by three and three on the top of each other, with their Å¿words and Å¿purs hanging by them: which alÅ¿o be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ides the worth of the preÅ¿ent Å¿ight, Å¿howes alÅ¿o the antiquity of the Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ion Å¿ince the choice of that place of buriall. The Funerall was appointed to be fiue dayes after the Princes departure, which was now at hand.</p>
            <p>After ten dayes Å¿tay therefore, on the 3. of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Prince tooke his leaue of the MarchioneÅ¿Å¿e ElectoreÅ¿Å¿e his Aunt, and of the reÅ¿t of the Court, and departed out of <hi>Berlin;</hi> and being accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with Prince <hi>Lodowick</hi> his Vncle, and Count <hi>Philip van Solmes,</hi> who from hence iournied with him all the way, and neuer left him till he came into <hi>Holland;</hi> they arriued the firÅ¿t night at an old City and a Å¿trong CaÅ¿tle called <hi>Spandaw,</hi> for now from <hi>Berlin</hi> we turned about again on the left hand and full WeÅ¿t: the riuer of <hi>Spre</hi> vpon which <hi>Berlin</hi> is Å¿ituated, being betwixt that City and this <hi>Spandaw.</hi> Here the Prince lodged all night, his prouiÅ¿ions and entertainments being all made at the charges of the MarchioneÅ¿Å¿e ElectoreÅ¿Å¿e. This <hi>Spandaw</hi> Å¿tands neere the conÅ¿cience of the two riuers <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel</hi> and <hi>Spre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day being the 4. of October, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces dined at a place called <hi>Sando,</hi> and the Å¿ame night they lodged at a Dorpe called <hi>BerneÅ¿e;</hi> which becauÅ¿e they be places of no great account, I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore paÅ¿Å¿e them ouer without any more deÅ¿cripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:20047:8"/>
            <p>The 5. of October the Princes dyned at the Citty of <hi>Ratenaw,</hi> which Å¿tands by the Riuer of <hi>Hauell,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this Citty, and to the North or NorthweÅ¿t loÅ¿es himÅ¿elfe and his name in the greater <hi>Elue</hi> or <hi>Albis.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dinner they Å¿et forwards againe, and came that night to the CaÅ¿tle of <hi>Tungermund</hi> on the Riuer <hi>Elue.</hi> The place is Å¿omething old, but what it is, is in the MarqueÅ¿Å¿e of <hi>Brandenburgs</hi> Dominions.</p>
            <p>The next day being the 6. of October, the Princes paÅ¿Å¿ed through the ForeÅ¿t of <hi>NeÅ¿lingham,</hi> where they alÅ¿o hunted; and that night they lay at the MarqueÅ¿Å¿es Lodge in the ForreÅ¿t: and thus farre the MarchioneÅ¿Å¿e Å¿ent her plate, furniture, and Å¿eruants to attend the Princes, and feaÅ¿ted them hitherto at her own charges. Which from hence being the boundary of the MarquiÅ¿ate on that Å¿ide, returned home againe towards <hi>Berline.</hi> And all this while we held our courÅ¿e full WeÅ¿t from <hi>Berline.</hi> By the WeÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ide of this ForeÅ¿t runs the Riuer <hi>Ohre,</hi> which we paÅ¿Å¿ed.</p>
            <p>The next day being the 7. of October, they entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>BrunÅ¿wick</hi> Land, and dyning at a Towne called <hi>Caluer,</hi> they came the Å¿ame night to a Colledge of Lutherans cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Miriando:</hi> where the Rector would not open his gates to receiue the Princes, vntil he heard his Princes the Duke of <hi>BrunÅ¿wicks</hi> pleaÅ¿ure, who was at the Å¿ame time 7. miles off from that place. Here we Å¿tayed 2. houres and aboue, in a terrible Å¿torme of rayne and winde, vntill a PoÅ¿t which the PrinceÅ¿Å¿e had diÅ¿patched the night before vnto the Duke, was returned. Vpon whoÅ¿e arryuall with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the Duke, the PrinceÅ¿Å¿e were receiued with all fitting reÅ¿pects, and the beÅ¿t entertainement that the place could afford. The Rector and the Society excuÅ¿ed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elues
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20047:9"/> by reaÅ¿on of the times, which were dangerous, and full of Å¿uÅ¿pition, and the perÅ¿ons of the Princes vnknown to any of them, and the Colledge it Å¿elfe being a place of importance. A tedious night this was and a could, and Å¿ome were wet with the rayne, and otherÅ¿ome Å¿capt bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But that which gaue vs Å¿ome comfort, was; that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout midnight there came another PoÅ¿t from the Duke, who requeÅ¿ted the Princes to Å¿tay there all the next day alÅ¿o, for that the Duke had not made his prouiÅ¿ion for their entertainement at his Court in Å¿uch a Å¿hort warning. And in the meane his Highnes Å¿ent in his own furniture for the Princes table, and commanded Å¿uch prouiÅ¿ion to be brought in, as the Country there abouts could afford, Å¿o that we had there the next day by dinner time, all things fitting for entertainement.</p>
            <p>The next day being the 9. of October, the Princes left the Colledge, and Å¿et on towards <hi>Wolfenbuttell,</hi> the chiefe place of reÅ¿idence of the Duke of <hi>BrunÅ¿wick,</hi> &amp; where the Court then was. But a little before we came to the Citty, the Duke of <hi>BrunÅ¿wick</hi> himÅ¿elfe, with the L. Chancellor of the Duchy, diuers of the priuy Councell, with many Nobles and Gentlemen, came forth of the Towne, with many faire Companies of horÅ¿e, to entertain the 2. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; Å¿o went along together with them into the Town. Within which were diuers Companies of Souldiers with full Armies vnder their Å¿euerall EnÅ¿ignes with Colours flying, with Trumpets Å¿ounding, Fifes playing, &amp; Drums beating in warlike manner, very gallant to behold, which Å¿tood along vntill wee came to the CaÅ¿tle. The Hault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyes and Cornets playing in the meane time from of the top of a Tower, and a peale of Ordinance being Å¿hot

            <p>The Princes were led into very Å¿tately, rich, and fayer Roomes in the CaÅ¿tle, and euery where in the houÅ¿e there Princely plenty and variety of all things neceÅ¿Å¿ary.</p>
            <p>The Princes hauing repoÅ¿ed themÅ¿elues a while, were by the Duke brought into the DutcheÅ¿Å¿e Chamber, who being allied to them both, receiued them with all Ioy and contentment.</p>
            <p>Supper time being come, the Princes were againe brought into a wondrous faier roome, where the Tables were couered and great Å¿tate vÅ¿ed according to the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man faÅ¿hion of entertainement, which is full and Å¿ump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous. In this Å¿upping place, there was a roome wherein there was a very large and rich Cupboard of plate; at one end of which Å¿tood the muÅ¿ick of InÅ¿truments and voices, and at the other end Å¿tood the Officers of the Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and Buttery, to fill wine and beer to the table. For here is beere in this Country which is rare in other places of <hi>Germany,</hi> though Å¿carce good any where. Yet here at this <hi>Wolfenbuttell,</hi> is a huge vaÅ¿t Tunne, larger then that of <hi>Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleberg,</hi> but this is filled with <hi>BrunÅ¿wick</hi> beer, as that other with RheniÅ¿h wine. There were alÅ¿o 6. other tables, where the 2.

            <p>Leauing therefore this Citty the 14. of October in the morning, the Å¿ame day they came to a place called <hi>Stanberge,</hi> where the Princes dyned at the Dukes char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.

En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the Gates, they were welcomed with a peale of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; and Å¿o by the TowneÅ¿men in Armour, they were brought into the CaÅ¿tle of <hi>Spanberg,</hi> where the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Captaine entertained them with their forces marÅ¿halled in warlike order. Here the Princes were fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ted 4. dayes.</p>
            <p>In the meane Å¿pace it was conÅ¿ulted vpon for the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Å¿afety; that Å¿eeing they were now to paÅ¿Å¿e by diuers GarriÅ¿ons of the Enemies: that it were beÅ¿t to diÅ¿patch a PoÅ¿t before hand to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to certify his Excellency of the PrinceÅ¿Å¿es neerenes, which was alÅ¿o
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20047:11"/> done. Both the Armies of the States and the Spaniards being then about <hi>WeÅ¿el.</hi> Here it was alÅ¿o agreed vpon to Å¿end Prince <hi>Lodowick</hi> with Å¿ome others another way into <hi>Holland;</hi> that Å¿o the Country-people might be Å¿atisfied with his preÅ¿ence in Å¿tead of the Princes; which tooke effect accordingly; and did not onely giue the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple good content through whom he paÅ¿Å¿ed, who came flocking into the high waies to Å¿ee him; but alÅ¿o diuerted their expectations, from any thought of his paÅ¿Å¿age any other way: by meanes whereof, his Highnes the Prince of <hi>Bohemia</hi> paÅ¿Å¿ed in his way with the more Å¿afety and Å¿ecrecy.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Spanburg</hi> CaÅ¿tle we came next to the CaÅ¿tle of <hi>Arden,</hi> which is vnder the Graue of <hi>Benthem;</hi> and Å¿o by <hi>Glandorpe</hi> to <hi>Mareling,</hi> where we lodged all night. From whence forward the Towns being neer &amp; Å¿o well known, I forbeare to make any further deÅ¿cription of them, but onely name them as we paÅ¿Å¿e through them.</p>
            <p>From thence we went to <hi>RuÅ¿Å¿enbeck;</hi> from thence to <hi>Embsbourne;</hi> from thence to <hi>North-horne;</hi> from thence to <hi>Hardenberg,</hi> where we lodged. From thence we went to <hi>Realte;</hi> from thence to <hi>Deuenter</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> where we met with the Princes againe.</p>
            <p>The next day we Å¿et forwards towards <hi>Swoll,</hi> which is a Å¿trong Town of GarriÅ¿on; where we Å¿taied two nights and one day. And here the Count <hi>ErneÅ¿t</hi> van <hi>CaÅ¿simere</hi> (who comming in PoÅ¿t from the Prince of <hi>Oranges</hi> Leaguer at <hi>WeÅ¿el,</hi> had before met with the Princes) receiued the Prince into his charge, and Å¿afe protection. And here Prince <hi>Lodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> departed from his Highnes, &amp; went directly towards the <hi>Hage:</hi> And Prince <hi>Frederick</hi> kept on towards <hi>Freez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:20047:11"/>
            <p>The next day at dinner being the 25. of October, wee came to a Citty of GarriÅ¿on called <hi>Steenwick,</hi> where his HighneÅ¿Å¿e was met by the Burgers in Armes, &amp; receiued into the Town with a volley of Å¿hot, and comming to the CaÅ¿tle they diÅ¿charged a peale of Ordinance for his welcome: and all marched by in warlike manner in the Princes view.</p>
            <p>From thence after dinner they came to <hi>Wolfingow,</hi> where they reÅ¿ted all that night.</p>
            <p>The next day, they dined at <hi>Hernenfen,</hi> and came the Å¿ame night to <hi>Luerden</hi> in <hi>Freezland,</hi> the place whether at his firÅ¿t Å¿etting out of <hi>Prage,</hi> it was his intention to goe. Here the chiefeÅ¿t of the Town met the Prince on HorÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back. At the entrance thereof, the Ordinance of the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were diÅ¿charged to welcome him: and the Burgers within the Town in Armes, ranking themÅ¿elues on each Å¿ide; conueied his Highnes to the CaÅ¿tle being the Court of <hi>Count ErneÅ¿tus van CaÅ¿simerus;</hi> at that inÅ¿tant time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing receiued in Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ion of <hi>Count William of NaÅ¿Å¿aw</hi> his brother lately deceaÅ¿ed, for Gouernour of <hi>Friezland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince being come to the Court, and brought to an exceeding faire Chamber, beheld all the TownÅ¿men marching by in their Armes: &amp; then being brought to the Chamber of the CounteÅ¿Å¿e, he was there moÅ¿t Nobly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by them both, with all ioy and Å¿olemnity.</p>
            <p>And thus it pleaÅ¿ed the Almighty God to leade this Å¿weet young Princes firÅ¿t one way, and then againe another way, now through friends Countries, and now through foes, as from <hi>Heidleberg</hi> in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> to <hi>Prage</hi> in <hi>Bohemia</hi> at firÅ¿t; Å¿o now againe from <hi>Prage</hi> to <hi>Luerden:</hi> which is almoÅ¿t round about the middle part
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20047:12"/> of <hi>Germany.</hi> A Iourney by Land which would haue tired the little <hi>IÃ¼l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
